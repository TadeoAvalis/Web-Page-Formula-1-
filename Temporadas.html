	<h1>Formula One's History</h1>

        <h2>How it Started</h2>
        <p>
            The roots of Formula One (F1) can be traced back to the 1920s and 1930s when Grand Prix racing became popular in Europe. The first World Championship for Drivers was held in 1950, organized by the sport's governing body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The championship was contested over seven races in Europe, with Italian driver Giuseppe Farina emerging as the inaugural champion. The early years of F1 were dominated by European manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Mercedes-Benz. However, the sport has since expanded to become a global phenomenon with races held across the world and featuring drivers and teams from every continent.

        <h4>Juan Manuel Fangio</h4>
        <p>
            Juan Manuel Fangio is widely considered one of the greatest drivers of all time, and for good reason. He won five F1 World Championships during the 1950s, a time when safety standards were much lower and drivers faced a far greater risk of injury or death. Fangio was known for his smooth driving style, his ability to adapt to any situation, and his strategic approach to racing. He was a master of his craft, and his success during an era when the sport was much more dangerous than it is today has cemented his status as an F1 legend.

        <h2>Major Accidents</h2>
        <p>
            Formula One has seen its fair share of major accidents throughout its history. One of the most infamous crashes happened in 1994 when Ayrton Senna, one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time, died during the San Marino Grand Prix. Another significant accident was in 1998 at the Belgian Grand Prix, where a massive pile-up occurred after the first corner. More recently, in 2014, Jules Bianchi crashed into a recovery vehicle at the Japanese Grand Prix, causing severe head injuries, which led to his tragic death the following year. These accidents and others have highlighted the importance of safety measures and the continuous efforts to improve them in Formula One.
