        <p>
            In Formula One (F1), teams are an essential part of the sport, as they design, build, and race the cars that compete in the championship. Each team consists of a group of engineers, designers, mechanics, and support staff who work together to create a competitive and reliable car.<br>

        <p>
            Teams also hire drivers, who are responsible for racing the cars on the track and scoring points towards the drivers' championship. In F1, teams compete against each other in a season of races held across different countries and continents, with the ultimate goal of winning the constructors' championship by accumulating the most points throughout the season. Over the years, F1 has seen some legendary teams, such as Ferrari, McLaren, and Williams, who have left their mark on the sport with their innovative designs and successful performances on the track. Today, there are ten teams competing in the championship, each with its own unique history, culture, and approach to racing.

        <h2>The Cars</h2>
        <p>
            Formula One (F1) cars are some of the most technologically advanced and fastest racing cars in the world. They are single-seat, open-cockpit cars that are designed and built by each team to meet the regulations set by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). F1 cars are powered by hybrid engines that use both petrol and electric power to generate over 1,000 horsepower, allowing them to reach speeds of over 200 mph. They feature advanced aerodynamics, with intricate designs and components that create downforce and help the car stick to the track. F1 cars also have a variety of complex systems, such as energy recovery systems and sophisticated data acquisition systems, which allow teams to fine-tune the car's performance and maximize their chances of success. Every year, teams introduce new innovations and upgrades to their cars, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of speed, power, and technology.
